{dark_gray}Vampirism (or Vempyrism) is a path few dare to take,
but which offers powerful resources and abilities to
those who dare to walk its way.{}

> Becoming one is as simple as perishing under the
> effects of Bloodlust. To those who lack the gift
> of resurrection, a Totem of Undying can save your
> soul while still tainting it to Vampirism.

;;;;;

{dark_gray}Vempyres' main ability comes from drawing blood of entities;
While human blood works best, all can be used to conjure abilities.{}

> For the relevancy of this book, it is assumed
> you have already taken such path. If not, the
> following pages detail a simple walkthrough
> of all the steps and requirements to become
> a Vempyre yourself.

**Vempyrism 101**

{dark_gray}Requirements:

- Human (of type `Player`)
- Mortal (must be able to die; surviving is optional){}

---

{dark_gray}First, obtain an enhanced/strong Vial of Blood. To obtain one:

- Brew {gold}Glowstone Dust{} and a {blue}Water Bottle{} to make a {dark_blue}Thick Potion{};
- Brew {red}Beetroot{} and a {dark_blue}Thick Potion{} to make a {dark_red}Vial of Blood{};
- Brew {gold}Glowstone Dust{} and a {dark_red}Vial of Blood{} to make a strong {dark_red}Vial of Blood{}.

The final product should look something like this:{}

<item;minecraft:potion[potion_contents={custom_color:5966346,custom_name:"blood",custom_effects:[{id:"goldark:bloodlust",ambient:true,duration:400},{id:"unluck",ambient:true,duration:1}]}]>

;;;;;

{dark_gray}Next, optionally obtain a {yellow}Totem of Undying{};
Such procedures fall outside the scope of this book, but will
be of aid if resurrection isn't desirable or not possible at all.{}

---

{dark_gray}Afterwards, get yourself a hostile or neutral entity; It must
be capable of melee damage and be strong enough to take down
the player within the effect's duration. Naturally-spawned
Iron Golems and large Slimes are efficient at taking down an
armor-less player with ease.{}

;;;;;

{dark_gray}Finally, the sacrifice. Drink the potion, and with the
Totem in your offhand (if you got one), perish to the
direct attack of the hostile entity.{}

> The entity must be your cause of death
> (i.e. "Player was slain by Entity");
> Indirect means (arrows, magic, etc) will
> not trigger the desirable effect, and
> thus will not convert you to a Vempyre.

;;;;;

{dark_gray}If the skies turn black and you hear the cries of above,
congratulations, you are a Vempyre.{}

---

{dark_gray}Should you be successful, the entries of this book
shall be of great aid to your path. Otherwise, please follow
along through the next pages to hopefully correct whatever 
might've gone wrong with your transformation.{}

;;;;;

**# "I got killed but I'm still human!"**

- {dark_gray}Did you have Bloodlust II before perishing? This is
key for the magic to be triggered.
- Alternatively, you got shot by a Skeleton, killed by
a Witch's potion, a Warden's sonic attack, etc.. Those
are *indirect* attacks, and will not trigger Vampirism.
A *direct* attack would be a Zombie, Wither Skeleton,
or any other mob with similar behaviors.{}

;;;;;

**# "I got killed and can't play anymore!"**

- {dark_gray}You were likely on Hardcore Mode. Bloodlust will *not*
prevent perma-death, that's what the Totem of Undying's for.
- Otherwise, try checking other mods installed.
Vampirism will *never* change your gamemode, even when transformed.{}

;;;;;

**# "I did everything and don't see a change!"**

- {dark_gray}If it is nighttime, changes might not be so obvious.
Other than the achievement you receive post-transformation,
a simple way to check your Vampirism is by punching an animal.
If you see a "Blood Meter" show up above your hotbar, you're
a Vempyre.{}

;;;;;

**# "It's too punishing!"**

- {dark_gray}I can understand the frustration. However,
Vampirism is a powerful asset on the hands of those who
take the time to master it; Thus why it was banished of
common schools of magic, and thus why the existence of
this book.
- If you truly feel this is too cumbersome, the potions
of {gold}Holy Numbness{} and {gray}Purity{} can aid you.
The former will remove all harm from sunlight; The latter,
any and every effect of Vampirism entirely. Its enhanced
version can actually cleanse Vampirism entirely, making
you fully human again.

;;;;;

**# "It's too powerful."**

- Perhaps. If you are the Vempyre, a potion with Purity II
will completely cure Vampirism when drunk. Otherwise, try
convincing the other player to choose another path, say,
Lycanthropy, for example.
