Empowered by the moon, Werewooves are half-wolf hybrids who can turn into 
a powerful Wolf-like form at will. They hunt at Full Moons, and prey onto 
nearly anything that moves... including you.

Werewooves are primarily weak to {gray}Iron{}, even in small amounts.
Afflicted with an aversion to holiness, they'll burn unlike anything else
if exposed for too long -- to the point of consuming even their very own soul.

Legends say of a method to become one of such creatures.
The process is demanding and highly lethal, but should turn
you into a Werewoof by the end of it.

Worse fates could be given, though...

- **Must be done on a Full Moon.**

Notes:

- Ritual is deadly, but has short range. You can always leave if things get too dangerous.
- Once a Werewoof, sprint backwards (<keybind;key.sprint>+<keybind;key.back>) to transform.

> Wolf form is tanky, use with mild abundance.

A neat Werewoof trivia: Wild Wolves target anything
your transformed form does. Create your own woof pack!
