Vempyres are creatures inflicted with an
insatiable urge to consume {dark_red}blood{}.
Be it human, animal, or even alien, they feast
upon the living essence of their victims.

Seen as unholy by the Light God, Vempyres
are doomed to burn in sunlight; While water
may somewhat help, it is but a brief relief.

Becoming one is surprisingly simple, but costly;
One must lose themselves to be reborn a Vempyre again.

Once consequences befall you, however,
[Purity](^goldark:effects/purity) may
still be achievable... if you are willing
to pay its price.
