Bloodlust is a status effect which grants the victim
an unsatiable desire for blood; It is a lesser form
of [Vampirism](^goldark:paths/vempyre).

"Artificial" blood can be created from brewing Beetroots
with a Thick Potion. These inflict the same Bloodlust
effect, and its enhanced form is capable of turning
victims into full Vempyres, should they be killed while
under its influence.
