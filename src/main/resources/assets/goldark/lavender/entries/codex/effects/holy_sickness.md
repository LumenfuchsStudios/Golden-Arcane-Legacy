Holy Sickness is a complex, hidden effect which weakens its victim
and burns them in divine fury, increasing in severity for as long as
the effect remains active.

> While the effect is active, traits from [arcane paths](^goldark:arcane_paths)
> are temporarily disabled. Additionally, [Werewooves](^goldark:paths/werewoof)
> are unable to transform while under the influence of Holy Sickness.

While dangerous, there are methods to help, if not outright
avoid its impact entirely:

- The best countermeasure is [Holy Numbness](^goldark:effects/holy_numbness),
an effect designed specifically to aid with this ailment.
- For [Vempyres](^goldark:paths/vempyre), drinking water can help
with the fury of the Sun for a brief amount of time.

> In fact, water is a great measure for most lesser
> cases of Holy Sickness.

- If all else fails, the [Purity](^goldark:effects/purity) effect can prevent
any Holy Sickness from occurring at all.
