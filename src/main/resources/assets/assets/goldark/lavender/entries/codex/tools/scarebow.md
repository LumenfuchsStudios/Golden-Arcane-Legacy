As cousins of [Scarecrows](^goldark:tools/scarecrow),
Scarebows possess a similar effect, but against projectiles:
Arrows are broken, tridents are repelled, and other objects
are stopped in the air before harmlessly falling to the ground.

Like scarecrows, any wooden fence and pumpkin variant will do.
