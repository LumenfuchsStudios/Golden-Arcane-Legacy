TODO:

* Golden Arrow has its own sound events (and appropriate files unless a vanilla sound is *really* the best option)
  * Custom boss music for Golden Arrow
* REWRITE OF WHOLE DAMN FIGHT
  * Instead of a random chaos of possible attacks, the whole battle is *mostly* scripted, with some RNG at certain intervals and at the last[, desperation] phase.
  * Add dialogue for the guy. I always wanted dialogue from (him?).

# (ABYSS' Void insta-kills anything (unless...), Heavens's upper Layer can only be accessed in Creative)
# (Both ??? Layers are final; The Player may only ascend/descend to the same Layer they were previously)
