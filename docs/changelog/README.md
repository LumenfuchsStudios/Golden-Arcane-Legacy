## Planned Updates

Some updates are planned for future versions of the datapack, including new mechanics, ports of old systems or brand new entities.

In order of most to least fleshed out, the so far planned future Golden Arcane updates:

* *Summoning Update*, replacing Golden Arrow's summoning method with the original Bedrock Add-On's Altar summoning mechanic. As this is the only surviving feature of the original Add-On after [Our Tales'](../Our_Tales.md) deletion and the Add-On's rewrite, it should be quite simple to implement in the Java datapack version.

* *Pact o' Devil* Update, fully implementing the halfway-done **Golden Curse** from the original "The Golden Arcane"; Players will need this Curse to interact with the summoning mechanic, and defeating Golden Arrow (or one of its sibling Golden bosses, yet to be added as well) will cause this curse to weaken and provide specific benefits instead.

* *Update o' Colors* (yes, a reference to Minecraft 1.12) is a still highly conceptual update involving the use of flowers and regular dyes to establish the foundation of most the datapack's magic, being the first available magical feature to the player.
