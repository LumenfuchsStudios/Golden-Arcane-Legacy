# Version 0.3.0 - Expansion [Indev]

0.3.0 is an overhaul of Golden Arcane's magic system, including a full rewrite of how spells are registered and executed, an array of new Charms available to the player, and two brand new custom dimensions (with a new method of inter-dimensional travel to them), both with their own unique traits and utilities.

Version 0.3.0 completely overhauls 0.2.0's spells system, and thus is *completely incompatible* with the previous version's spell items. Previous worlds will not break, but the items will no longer have any effect upon consumption.
