# Version 0.3.0 - Rewrite [Indev]

0.3.0 overhauls spells' creation and execution systems, introduces new magics and mechanics, as well as two new dimensions (currently very early in development). It also removes some previously unused/poor quality content.

Version 0.3.0 completely overhauls 0.2.0's spell system, and thus is *completely incompatible* with the old system's items. Previous worlds will not break, but those items will no longer have any effect upon consumption.

## Contents

* Added Essences, a new interaction between flowers and their environment.
  * To trigger an Essence, drop a Gold Nugget on a flower. (Subject to change)
  * Alternatively, summon an Essence directly by `/function goldark:magic/summon/essence_dummy { spell_id: "<color>" }`, with `<color>` being the name of the Essence's respective color.
    * As of now, only Light Gray (`lgray`) and Red (`red`) possess an Essence. The affected flowers are as follow:
      * Light Gray: Azure Bluet, Oxeye Daisy, White Tulip
      * Red: Poppy, Red Tulip, Rose Bush

* Temporarily removed certain content (dimensions and spell items) until the aforementioned feature is fully fleshed out.
