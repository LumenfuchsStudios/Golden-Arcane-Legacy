Magical Catalysts are naturally-magical objects which power all sorts of magic.
They're easily identified by their shiny nature, akin to Gold itself.

When a catalyst exists in both item and block form, the item may be used 
for recipes, and the block for Altars and rituals alike.

;;;;;

The following items may be used as a catalyst:

- Glowstone
- Amethyst
- Shroomlight
- Sculk*

> \* Only the "Sculk" block may be used; Other sculk-related items do not count as catalysts.
