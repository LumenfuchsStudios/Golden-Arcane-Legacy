Thunder Eggs are rare variants of regular eggs
which may be found while collecting a chicken's
produce. When thrown, they create an electrical
discharge at their hit location.

> Beware! The egg's energy is highly unstable;
> Always do a step behind before hurling one in
> the air, lest you want to fry yourself alive instead.

Thunder Eggs also have a rarer, much stronger
variant: *Thunderous Eggs*. When broken, they
release a powerful, short-lived storm which
hunts down nearby creatures, fulminating them
on the spot and raising them to the skies
for a painful demise -- be it fire or gravity.

> Such Storms are difficult to escape from, but
> easy to distract; Always make sure there are
> enough victims nearby to cover your escape.
