Holy Numbness is a hidden effect which reduces consequences
of grim [Arcane Paths](^goldark:arcane_paths), such as
Werewooves or Vempyres: Touching or holding Iron, standing
under sunlight, and even external magics are all ignored
while the effect is active.

> Drinking Milk or receiving the [Purity](^goldark:effects/purity)
> effect will remove Holy Numbness.
