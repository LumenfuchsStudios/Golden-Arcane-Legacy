# Golden Arcane

**Golden Arcane** is a *Minecraft: Java Edition* datapack exploring the concept of magic with a common motif: Gold.

From ancient deities to reality-tearing rituals, forbidden knowledge and odd artifacts of olden times, the world is full of new magic everywhere for the keen-eyed to find. A good starting point would be a flowery garden, where one can craft their first guide into the wonders of Golden Arcane.

## Installation & Update

Download the ZIP archive from the latest version at the [Releases](https://github.com/LumenfuchsStudios/GoldenArcane/releases) page and extract it on your world's `datapacks` folder. Enter the world and the pack should be automatically loaded.

For more information, see the [Minecraft Wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Installing_a_data_pack) on how to install a datapack.

To update an existing world's datapack, delete the `Golden-Arcane` folder at `datapacks` and repeat the same procedures for installation.

## Usage

To-Do! In the meantime, you can run `/function goldark:spells/codex` in-game for a Written Book featuring all capabilities of the datapack. Sorry for the inconvenience!
