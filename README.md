# Golden Arcane

**Golden Arcane** is a *Minecraft: Java Edition* datapack exploring the concept of magic with a common motif: Gold.

From ancient deities to reality-tearing rituals, forbidden knowledge and odd artifacts of olden times, the world is full of new magic everywhere for the keen-eyed to find.

## About

> "Upon the legendary creation of the Universe, four Divine Forces were conceived. Of those, *Auryos*, God of Gold, bears the closest link to mankind. By its blessings upon the world, scholars are able to channel mystical energies into their will, thus conjuring supernatural change to their reality."

TO WRITE. Sorry.

## Installation & Update

To update an existing world's datapack, delete the `Golden-Arcane` folder at `datapacks` and repeat the same procedures above.
