**Golden Arcane** is a *Minecraft: Java Edition* datapack exploring the concept of magic with a common motif: Gold.

From ancient deities to reality-tearing rituals, forbidden knowledge and odd artifacts of olden times, the world is full of new magic everywhere for the keen-eyed to find. A good starting point would be a flowery garden, where one can craft their first guide into the wonders of Golden Arcane.

While perfectly fine on its own, this datapack is balanced around the idea of being an alternative way to magic, with skills and abilities which may feel somewhat overpowered against vanilla Minecraft. Nonetheless, all magic is built with a principle of *seek-it-first* in mind; No feature should ever impact your world in any meaningful way unless you (or another player) interact with it beforehand.

## Magic that is Within

Golden Arcane's features are primarily focused around magic inherent to all living beings -- whether that be animals, plants, or even the player themselves. Magic is designed to be available everywhere, with ingredients being often replaceable with alternatives as the user sees fit.

## Magic to be Shared

Golden Arcane is made with Multiplayer compatibility in mind, so that multiple people can enjoy the datapack's ~~quirks~~ features in the same world.

Furthermore, functions are *caller-agnostic*: That is, they'll work the same whether the user of magic is a player or otherwise.

Mobs will react to spells, paths and custom effects in the same way a player would -- watch the tables turn when your Werewoof chicken turns into a tanky Wolf with a taste for human flesh.

## Magic that is Alive

Werewooves transform on Full Moons. Chickens lay eggs charged with the fury of the skies. Some Storms might even descent and actively go after entities to consume in heavenly flames. The world reacts to the player and to itself, if only it be allowed to do so.

## Platforms

*Golden Arcane* is primarily available on GitHub. Other sites are planned as soon as it reaches v1.0.0, i.e. its first release version.
